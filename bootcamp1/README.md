## Bootcamp 1: Linux, Python and robotics

As indicated by the title, this bootcamp aims to introduce students to several essentail tools: Ubuntu Linux, Python programming and the development of (autonomous) robotic systems. 
The bootcamp include two parts. First, an online preparation component, which is completed independently by the student. Second, an instructor-led session which will be
held virtually (during MT term 2020 at least). 


### Online preparation (~ 0.5-2 hours)

Given that student's backgrounds may differ, this section could be skipped by some, completed in 30 minutes by others or may take a couple of hours. 
Go through it as slowly as you need! **No need to install any special software on your computer.** The recommended resourses are:
* [Kaggle mini-course on Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python). We recommended you finish sections 1-5. 
Side bonus: you will be awared a certificate if finish all sections. 
* [The Linux command line for beginner](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview). We recommend you go through section 1, 3 and 4 at least. 
If you have access to a linux terminal, use it! Otherwise, you may use online tools such as [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/projects/0bf48ed3-5f52-4c43-a332-14b9b4fa168f/files/Welcome%20to%20CoCalc.term?session=default).

### Instructor-led session (~ 2 hours + Q&A) 

#### Linux walk-through (~ 30 minutes)
